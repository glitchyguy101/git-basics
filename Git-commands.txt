## Git Commands ##

Git is the version control system that is used to track changes of your code file.
Github is a Web-based hosting service for the Git Repositories.

1. git status => repository status
2. git init => command will create a new folder on your system and initialize it as a git repository. This adds a hidden .git folder to your project.

Complete git flow:-

    WRITE -->(staging area) --> ADD -->(Repo) --> COMMIT --> (Github) --> PUSH

3.git add <file2_name> <file2_name>  OR  git add .

4. git commit -m "commit message"

5.git log (gives full logs)  OR git log --oneline  (short logs)

6. gitignore :- Gitignore is a file that tells git which files and folders to ignore. It is a way to prevent git from tracking certain files or folders.

## Branches:-

1. git branch => This command lists all the branches in the current repository.
2. git branch <branch_name> =>  This command creates a new branch.
3. git switch <branch_name>  OR  git checkout <branch_name>  =>This command switches to the <branch_name>.
4. git switch -c dark-mode  => This command creates a new branch called dark-mode. the -c flag is used to create a new branch.

## Merging :-

1. git checkout main - This command switches to the main branch.
2. git merge bug-fix - This command merges the bug-fix branch into the main branch.


## Rename a branch:-

1. git branch -m <old-branch-name> <new-branch-name>

## Delete a branch:-

1. git branch -d <branch-name>

## Checkout branch:-

1. git checkout <branch-name>

##List all branchs:-

1. git branch


### Diff, Stash and Tags: https://docs.chaicode.com/youtube/chai-aur-git/diff-stash-tags/

## Diff:-

1. git diff --staged => This command shows the changes between your last commit and the staging area (i.e., changes that are staged and ready to be committed).

Comparing Two Branches:-
        git diff <branch-name-one> <branch-name-two>

Comparing Specific Commits::-
        git diff <commit-hash-one> <commit-hash-two>


## Git Stash:- Stash is a way to save your changes in a temporary location. It’s useful when switching branches without losing work. You can then come back to the file later and apply the changes.

1. git stash =>  use the git stash command to save your changes in a temporary location.

# Naming the stash:-
        git stash save "work in progress on X feature"

# View the stash list:-
        git stash list

# Apply the Most Recent Stash:-
        git stash apply

# Apply Specific Stash:-
        git stash apply stash@{0}

# Applying and Drop a Stash:-
        git stash pop

# Drop the stash:-
        git stash drop

# Applying stash to a specific branch:-
        git stash apply stash@{0} <branch-name>

# Clearing the stash:-
        git stash clear


### Git tags:-

Creating a tag:-
        1. git tag <tag-name>

#Create an annotated tag:-
        2. git tag -a <tag-name> -m "Release 1.0"


# List all tags:-
        3. git tag  => This command lists all the tags in your repository.

# Tagging a specific commit
        4. git tag <tag-name> <commit-hash>


# Delete a tag
        5.git tag -d <tag-name>

# Delete tag on remote repository:- You can delete a tag on a remote repository using the following command:
        6.git push origin :<tag-name>
